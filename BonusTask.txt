 To avoid storing a personal security token in GitHub, we may create an environment variable TOKEN, and set it the value of our token.
 Every person that uses our code has to create the same variable and set it the value of their own token.
 Thus everyone having a token will be able to run tests, but the token won't be stored in a public place.
